# Lab 2 - Linked List

### Purpose
To build a single-linked list with the use of templates while handling memory management.

### Background
Develop a Linked List that performs several standard operations. Linked Lists are common data structures in all object-oriented languages, and will play a vital role in your activities as a programmer.

### Requirements
This lab must be completed on the Linux OS.
You are required to use template classes that accept various types including ints, doubles, strings, etc.

###### Part 1 - Make The Linked List (14 points)
* Construct a Single-Linked List that can be used with template classes
* Successfully implement all of the methods found in the LinkedListInterface.h
###### Part 2 - No Leaks in the Hull (14 points)
* Run and pass ValGrind on your program to ensure that you have no memory leaks.
###### UML design document. (2 points)

### Requirement Notes
General
* You may not use the predefined C++ Standard Template Library (STL) classes.
* This lab must run on the Linux machines. The test driver will work only on those machines
* For this lab only, due to the difficulty of template classes, you are strongly encouraged to implement the entire class in only a '.h'.  All classes that are not templates must be implemented by a '.h' and a '.cpp'
