_Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passions, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence. - John Adams_

### How do database systems work?

**Parts of a Database System**
* Data
* DBMS / Engine
    - Defines, secures and queries the data
    - Responsible for data integrity, security and recovery
    - Non-visual / Back end
* Application Software
    - Front end; makes the engine visual; this is what the user interacts with

The engine and the application have a request/response cycle

### Types of Database systems
* PC Architecture
    - Data, front end, back end - all live on 1 computer - like Microsoft Access
    - Cheap & fast, but only serves 1 user
