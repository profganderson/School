## Ontology
* Things vs. Objects
    - Things are objects that exist in real life (has mass is an easy way to describe it, but not quite right....light is also a thing)

* Constructs are also objects, but they do not exist in real life. A point in time, a legal entity, etc.
    - They are often tied to things (customer is tied to a person)

* Occurences are constructs that come into existence at some point in time.
    - Occurences happen and sometime create another object - a product, a transaction, etc.
