I am grateful for difficult decisions. I'm glad that I am in a place in my life where multiple good options are vying for my time and attention. Even though it is stressful and frequently hard to choose, it makes me excited for the future and allows me a degree of flexibility in the way I live my life.

I am grateful for my health! It has been so much better to be able to do what I want when I want to and not be impeded by ailments. Last year, I had mono and it plagued me for a while, making it very hard to be productive. It is nice to not feel like that anymore.
